# Offline Apps Workshop

This repository contains the [workshop slides](https://slemke.github.io/generic-sensor-api-workshop/#/) 
"Generic Sensor API" for the course "web technologies" (Web Technologien) at the Cologne University 
of Applied Sciences. The slides itself are in german.

This [workshop](https://th-koeln.github.io/mi-master-wtw/workshops/2018/workshop-generic-sensor-api/index/) 
was part of the media computer science masters program with the main focus on web technologies.

**Workshop description:**

> This workshop deals with the Generic Sensor APIs, which can currently be tested in Google Chrome. At the beginning of the workshop, the various sensors are presented and examples of how they can be used are shown. It will then be checked whether each participant meets the requirements for taking part in the practical part of the workshop. A prototype is then developed together that uses the sensors presented.
